# Prerequisites for Network Configuration and Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## 1. Basic Knowledge Requirements

Before starting with network configuration and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following:

- **Networking Concepts**:
  - IP addressing and subnets
  - Routing and switching basics
  - Network protocols (e.g., HTTP, ICMP, SNMP)

- **System Administration**:
  - Familiarity with Linux commands and shell scripting
  - Knowledge of file permissions and processes

- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Basic understanding of Prometheus and Grafana architectures
  - Metrics and visualization concepts

## 2. Software Requirements

Ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your system:

- **Prometheus**:
  - Version: >= 2.x
  - [Installation Guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)

- **Grafana**:
  - Version: >= 9.x
  - [Installation Guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup/installation/)

- **Exporter Tools**:
  - Node Exporter for system metrics
  - SNMP Exporter for network device monitoring (optional based on use case)

- **Web Browser**: Modern browser for accessing Grafana dashboards

- **Text Editor**: Preferred editor for editing configuration files (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, or VS Code)

## 3. System Requirements

- **Operating System**:
  - Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian)

- **Hardware**:
  - Minimum 4 GB RAM
  - Minimum 2 CPU cores
  - 20 GB disk space

- **Network**:
  - Stable internet connection
  - Ability to access network devices for monitoring

## 4. Access and Permissions

- **User Privileges**:
  - Root or sudo access to install software and modify configurations

- **Network Device Access**:
  - Credentials and permissions to access SNMP or other network monitoring protocols for devices being monitored

## 5. Configuration Requirements

- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Open required ports for Prometheus and Grafana:
    - Prometheus: `9090`
    - Grafana: `3000`

- **Prometheus Configuration File**:
  - Basic YAML knowledge to edit the `prometheus.yml` configuration file

- **Grafana Data Sources**:
  - Ensure Prometheus is added as a data source in Grafana

## 6. Optional Tools

- **Docker** (Optional):
  - For containerized deployments of Prometheus and Grafana
  - [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- **Kubernetes** (Optional):
  - For monitoring containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster
  - [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)

## 7. Additional Resources

- [Prometheus Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
- [Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/)
- [Node Exporter Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/)
- [SNMP Exporter Documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter)

## 8. Testing the Environment

Before proceeding, verify:

- Prometheus is running and accessible at `http://<server-ip>:9090`
- Grafana is running and accessible at `http://<server-ip>:3000`
- Node Exporter (or other exporters) is successfully exposing metrics

This completes the prerequisites setup. Proceed to the installation and configuration steps to begin monitoring your network with Prometheus and Grafana.
