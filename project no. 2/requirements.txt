Prerequisites
System Requirements:

Control Plane Nodes:
Minimum 2 CPUs, 2 GB RAM, and 20 GB of storage.
Worker Nodes:
Minimum 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM, and 10 GB of storage per node.
Operating System:
Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, or equivalent)
Networking:
Reliable network connection with at least 1 Gbps bandwidth.
Software Dependencies:

Kubernetes:
Version: v1.24 or later
Container Runtime:
Containerd, CRI-O, or Docker (if using Kubernetes versions <=1.20)
Tools:
kubectl
kubeadm
helm
etcdctl (if managing etcd manually)
Networking Plugin:
CNI-compliant plugin (e.g., Calico, Flannel, or Weave Net).
Cloud Provider or Bare Metal:

If deploying on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure), ensure the necessary permissions for provisioning infrastructure.
Deployment Requirements
Cluster Configuration:

Highly Available (HA) setup with at least 3 control plane nodes.
Load balancer for control plane endpoints.
DNS resolution for Kubernetes API server and internal services.
Network Requirements:

Pod CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16 (default or customizable)
Service CIDR: 10.96.0.0/12 (default or customizable)
Port Accessibility:
Kubernetes API: 6443
Etcd: 2379-2380
Kubelet: 10250
Metrics Server: 10251
DNS: 53
Ingress Controller: Configurable based on the chosen plugin.
Security:

Enable RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
Use TLS for all communication between Kubernetes components.
Configure network policies for inter-pod communication.
Regularly update control plane and worker node components for patches.
Storage:

Integrate Persistent Volume (PV) management with storage backends (e.g., EBS, GCE Persistent Disks, or NFS).
Management Requirements
Monitoring:

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
Use Kubernetes Metrics Server for resource usage monitoring.
Logging:

Centralized logging using tools like Fluentd, Logstash, or Elasticsearch.
Autoscaling:

Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for workloads.
Enable Cluster Autoscaler for node scaling based on demand.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Regular etcd snapshots for control plane state.
Configure backup solutions for application data (e.g., Velero).
Updates:

Use a rolling update strategy for applications.
Upgrade Kubernetes cluster components (control plane and nodes) sequentially.
Access Management:

Integrate with Identity Providers (IDPs) for authentication (e.g., OIDC).
Restrict access using namespaces and resource quotas.
Optional Requirements
Ingress and Load Balancing:

Deploy an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
Configure external load balancing for internet-facing services.
CI/CD Integration:

Use tools like ArgoCD or Jenkins for automated application deployments.
Service Mesh:

Deploy Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management and observability.
