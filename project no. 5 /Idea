1. Project Overview

Start with a brief introduction:

Objective: Explain that the project aimed to automate the provisioning of infrastructure using Terraform to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficiency in managing cloud resources.
Scope: Mention the specific infrastructure components you provisioned (e.g., virtual machines, networking components, databases) and the cloud provider used (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

2. Understanding Terraform

Provide a foundational understanding of Terraform:

What is Terraform?: Describe Terraform as an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define and manage your 
infrastructure using declarative configuration files written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

Key Benefits:

Provider Agnostic: Terraform can work across multiple cloud platforms, allowing for a consistent approach to infrastructure management.
Version Control: Configuration files can be stored in version control systems (like Git), enabling collaboration and change tracking.
